# vajra-ui is NOT a normal dependency in website/package.json — it's not
# possible to depend on it via yarn's "file:.." protocol, because yarn
# classic (1.x) COPIES the target directory for file: deps rather than
# symlinking. Since website/ lives inside the vajra-ui repo, that copy
# recursively includes website/ itself, which includes node_modules/vajra-ui,
# which includes website/ again — infinite self-nesting that exhausted disk
# space the first time this was tried (grew to 3GB+ before being caught).
#
# The fix: a real symlink (not yarn's copy) from website/node_modules/vajra-ui
# to the repo root, created here as a postinstall step so `yarn install`
# always leaves it in a working state instead of needing to be run once and
# never touched again.

# vajra-ui-core is a separately published package, normally installed from
# npm (see package.json). While iterating locally before a publish, link it
# to the sibling vajra-ui-core checkout instead so fixes there are visible
# in the docs site without needing a real npm publish first. Safe to symlink
# directly (not the relative-path trick above) since vajra-ui-core lives
# outside this repo — no self-nesting risk.
